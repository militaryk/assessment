                    <p class="text1">Throughout the entire production of the website I made a few minimal changes and 1 major change. A major change I made was deciding to shrink the size of my title on the article pages as shown here. </p>
                    <img class="plan" src="images/before.PNG" alt="Title Before"><p class="text1">I felt that the main title on the article was to large and bulky and took up too much, so I decided to move it into the navigation bar so it didn't take up too much space and didn't stand out so much</p><img class="plan" src="images/after.PNG" alt="Title After">
