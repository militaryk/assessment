                <h1>Details</h1>
                <p class="text1">This website was designed by Kaden Adlington for a school assessment, Its purpose is to provide tourists and visitors with information on places to go in the different areas of Tauranga City, it provides visitors with direct links to the main websites to and gives a few recommended suggestions for each area to encourage the visitors to look at them.</p>
                <h1>Plan</h1>
                <h2>Home Page Layout Plan</h2>
                <img class="plan" src="images/index.jpg" alt="Plan Layout of Index">
                <h2>Article Page Layout</h2>
                <img class="plan" src="images/Article.jpg" alt="Plan of Article Layout">
                <h2>Colour Pallet</h2>
                    <p class="text1">The colour pallet I used was a simple design that used simple colours of greys and light grey and white and combined it with a pop of colour with the background, and a white box around the article to make it more readable.</p>
                    <h2>Refinements</h2>
                    <p class="text1">When I first started my website the design I hoped for changed quite drastically at the very beginning. I planned to do a nav that was a set of 9 diagonal squares however I felt this was too much of a challenge and would make the website possibly harder or more annoying to use. To make it more user suitable and less of a challenge I reverted back to working on a simple 3 squares on the main page that linked to the appropriate page.  I also cut down the number of pages I planned on doing by summarising the pages into areas of Tauranga and listing the attractions with external links. This was to lower the workload as well as to provide Quality not Quantity. Throughout the entire production of the website I made a few minimal changes and one major change. A major change I made was deciding to shrink the size of my title on the article pages as shown here. </p>
                    <img class="plan" src="images/before.PNG" alt="Title Before"><p class="text1">I felt that the main title on the article was to large and bulky and took up too much, so I decided to move it into the navigation bar so it didn't take up too much space and didn't stand out so much</p><img class="plan" src="images/after.PNG" alt="Title After">
                    <h2>Copyright</h2>
                    <p class="text1">To make sure this website is not violating copyright laws I have put effort into finding images that are creative commons or royalty free. Some images I have used state that they can be reused with credit. For images that require credit the Legal page has the links and sources.

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p class="text1">This website has been tested and is fully functional on Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Chrome for Android</p>
                    <img class="proof" src="images/chromewebsite.png" alt="Chrome Website"><img class="proof" src="images/edgewebsite.png" alt="Edge Website"><img class="proof" src="images/AndriodChrome.jpg" alt="Android Chrome Article Page"><img class="proof" src="images/AndroidChrome2.jpg" alt="Android Chrome Home Page">
                    <h2>Usabilty Testing</h2>
                    <p class="text1">My usability tester recommended that I move my title on the article page to the navigation bar cause it was too distracting. He also recommended for me to give the Maori names to for Mount Maunganui as it seemed to be needed. He also recommended a change on what color the links are when hovered over. All of these I have fixed in my refinements and made more friendly and easier to read and simple base design.
                

                   <!-- List of refinments -->
                    <li class="list">

                        <p class="text1">The link for the Licence in the footer was hard to read so coloured it light blue as it stood out more but could be told apart from the text</p>

                    <p class="text1"></p>
                    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                    <p class="text1">This website has a ALT text for every single image on the page so that it can be read by a screen reader it also uses a colour pallet that makes it readable to many and most colour-blind people.</p>
